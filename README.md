### http://stocktastic.herokuapp.com/
A small webapp for displaying recent stock data of user-defined stocks.

#### Tools
- **Front end**: I used the [angular-fullstack Yeoman generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack), alongside Angular Material, and a tiny bit of Bootstrap. C3.js was used to display the graph.
- **Back end**: Node.js & Express with MongoDB for storing user-entered stock codes.

#### User Stories
- As a user, I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
- As a user, I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
- As a user, I can remove stocks.
- (As a user, I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock.)
